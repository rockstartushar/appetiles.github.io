      <h3>Things you must consider while reading books(scriptures, spiritual, self help, autobiography).
      </h3>
      Here, I am providing you a  comprehensive answer but in a brief way(seems irony).
      While reading such books, there will be two case:
      The content in the book is intentionally giving message or learnings.
      The content in book is not giving you a message or learning. But you want to take learnings.
      So, in both the cases, it is must that the learning/message get (or take) must be correct. Now, the question arises that who will be judging that correctness..

      it's best to be our own authority while reading any scriptures(with all regards), spiritual books or autobiography.

      We can ask to people or refer other documents (who we believe ) for further understanding of content( we are reading ) but last decision must be through self verification(if required).

      We should make our beliefs but should be flexible to upgrade them( as it is not compulsory that what we believe in is always universally true..).
      <br />
      <b>Bonus for my dear readers..ðŸ˜‰:</b> If someone is looking for answers to the question, he/she first can understand the question as may be the answer is present in question itself..<br />
      Feel free to ask your queries or any further question in your mind.

    <div class="blog-content" id="blog2">
      Once in life, there comes a time, when we try to expect more from our ownself without knowing our own potential level.
      This meaningless expectations majorly cause of envy from others. <br />
      At this point of time, only a bright light of pure wisdom can change our foolish sight towards life. <br />
      <b> That wisdom is..</b><br />
      <i>Instead of running in a race of being foremost from everyone, it is better to try the longer, harder but satisfying and peaceful process of being superior(fine)..</i>

      Their is popular quote said..
      "If you don't respect yourself, nobody will respect you. "
      Let's understand this with a popular story on life..
      Once a time, there was a person who gone to a rich monk and asked..
      What is the value of life?
      The monk gave him a red ruby and offered that "If you want to know the value of life, firstly find the value of this stone(ruby) but don't sell it. "
      The person started finding..
      Firstly, he met a vegetable shopkeeper. He gave ruby to shopkeeper and asked about the price. Shopkeeper replied, "this stone shines very good. Take 2 kg of patotos, and sell this ruby to me. ".
      Then met, gold merchant who becomes ready to give any amount of money.
      And finally, he met diamond merchant. this ruby is priceless.
      The person got shocked and ran to the monk. Ask about all this.. Then monk said Regardless, whether you make your life equal value with potatoes, and make you famous. It's depends on your vision, how do you measure your life?
      Quotes:
      Love everything you have, you get, so that you always feel positive.
